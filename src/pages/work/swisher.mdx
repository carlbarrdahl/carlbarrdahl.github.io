Light-weight progressive webapp that lets you generate a Swish (swedish
sms payment app) QR code. This makes payments easier as you donâ€™t have
to type or browse phone numbers. Pretty useful when splitting bills
among a bunch of people.
Music
Enter your phone number, the amount and an optional message and a QR
code is generated to be scanned from the Swish app.

Sensitive data is encrypted in the URL using AES with an optional key.
No data is sent to any server.
