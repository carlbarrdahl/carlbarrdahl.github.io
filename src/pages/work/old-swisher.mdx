import Template from "../../templates/work"
export default (props) => <Template {...props} />   

Light-weight progressive webapp that lets you generate a Swish (swedish sms payment app) QR code. This makes payments easier as you donâ€™t have to type or browse phone numbers. Pretty useful when splitting bills among a bunch of people.

Enter your phone number, the amount and an optional message and a QR code is generated to be scanned from the Swish app.

Sensitive data is encrypted in the URL using AES with an optional key. No data is sent to any server.
