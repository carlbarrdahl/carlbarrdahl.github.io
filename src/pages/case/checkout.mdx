### Progressive Web App

> Progressive Web Apps enable fast, app-like experiences with the reach of the web. The user experience is immersive and loads instantly, even in poor network conditions. Think of it like a mobile app, but on the web without having to go to the App or Play Store.

> 53% of users do not have their favorite brand's app installed

> 43% of U.S. shoppers expect to be able to pick up where they left off when they return

> Our customers typically see a 20% revenue boost with a PWA, so every minute you don’t have a PWA is a minute spent with 20% less revenue on your busiest customer touchpoint. As an example, a retailer with $20 million in annual ecommerce revenue could lose $1.4 million by waiting a month to offer a PWA, and another $6.8 million by waiting six months.

### Web Payments
PaymentRequestAPI is a W3C standard for how we make payments on the web. 
ensuring the checkout process is fast and efficient.

> The Payment Request API is a system that was created to eliminate typing as much as possible so the checkout flow is smooth and hassle-free. This isn’t a new payment method, nor does it mean direct integration with payment processors. Instead, it’s an open and cross-browser standard that replaces traditional checkout flows by allowing merchants to request and accept any payment in a single API call.

> One of reasons why conversion rates are lower on mobile than on desktop is the difficulty of filling out forms on mobile. This means many online purchase forms are difficult to use, slow to load and refresh, and require multiple steps to complete.

> 61% expect their shopping and billing information to be remembered and filled in automatically

> In addition to queries for local businesses near them, people are relying on their phones to check store hours, directions, wait times, contact information, and increasingly, product availability. In fact, 41% of shoppers wish retailers would do a better job of sharing inventory information.


### Engage user with push notifications

- track order
- notify when product is in stock

> Status updates. Over the past two years, mobile searches for “track” + “package” have grown by over 120%. For example: “track my package” and “track a package.”4

### Lightning-fast performance

> As mobile page load time goes from 1 second to 5 seconds, the probability of bounce increases 90%.

> If you don’t make speed a key performance metric then your business may pay the price. We recently tested 900,000 mobile sites globally and found that the average time it takes to fully load a mobile page is 22 seconds10.
