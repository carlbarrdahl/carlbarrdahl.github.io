Documents are uniquely identified with a hash of its content to ensure everyone signs the same copy and no tampering is done. Signing and verification of users identity is done with BankID which is the leading electronic identification app in Sweden.</p>\n<p>Other services can easily be integrated by specifying webhooks that gets triggered when changes occur in the system.</p>\n<p>Future improvements could include adding Swish (similar to BankID but for sms payments) to add costs to creating documents or signatures. Users could also be notified by sms when contracts are assigned or new signatures created to connected contract.</p>\n<p>Some documents might be sensitive to store on central servers. In that case something like ipfs\n<a href=\"https://ipfs.io\"></a> could be used to store the documents and then secure them with smart contracts on a blockchain like Ethereum.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Pakt","date":"January 02, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/pakt/"}}
